# Ing. Lukáš Rod
I'm a **Software Engineer, Full Stack Web Developer, and Photographer**.

I love nature (Ore Mountains ❤), traveling, and urbex.

I graduated from **FIT CTU** Prague with a Master's degree (Ing.) in Web and Software Engineering (specialization Software
Engineering).

During my studies and projects, I had the opportunity to work with an inexhaustible number of technologies and
languages. I mainly fell in love with **React and Python**, which I would like to focus on in the future. But I like to learn new
things as well.
